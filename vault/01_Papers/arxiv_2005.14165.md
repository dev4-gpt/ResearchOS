## Executive Summary & Abstract
We demonstrate that scaling up language models greatly improves few-shot performance, sometimes even matching or exceeding prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. We train GPT-3, a 175-billion parameter autoregressive language model, and evaluate its performance on a wide variety of NLP tasks.

## Methodological Insights & System Architectures
- Evaluates enterprise LLM capabilities, inference scalability, and task boundaries.
- Examines empirical performance metrics, baseline comparisons, and statistical significance.

## Key Quantitative Findings & Benchmarks
- Focuses on operational ROI, labor market skill distribution, and multi-agent coordination.

Abstract
Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training
on a large corpus of text followed by ﬁne-tuning on a speciﬁc task. While typically task-agnostic
in architecture, this method still requires task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of
thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only
a few examples or from simple instructions – something which current NLP systems still largely
struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic,
few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art ﬁnetuning approaches. Speciﬁcally, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion
parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in
the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or ﬁne-tuning,
with tasks and few-shot demonstr
