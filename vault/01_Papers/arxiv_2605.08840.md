## Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) face growing challenges in efficient generative inference due to the increasing memory demands of Key-Value (KV) caches, especially for long sequences. Existing eviction methods typically retain KV pairs with high attention weights but overlook the impact of attention redistribution caused by token removal, as well as the spatial-temporal dynamics in KV selection. In this paper, we propose ReST-KV, a robust KV eviction method that combines layer-wise output Reconstruction and Spatial-Temporal smoothing to provide a more comprehensive perspective for the KV cache eviction task. Specifically, ReST-KV formulates KV cache eviction as an optimization problem that minimizes output discrepancies through efficient layer-wise reconstruction. By directly modeling how each token's removal affects the model output, our method naturally captures attention redistribution effects, going beyond simplistic reliance on raw attention weights. To further enhance robustness, we design exponential moving average smoothing to handle temporal variations and an adaptive window-based mechanism to capture spatial patterns. Our method, ReST-KV, significantly advances performance on long-context benchmarks. It surpasses state-of-the-art baselines by 2.58% on LongBench and 15.2% on RULER. Additionally, ReST-KV consistently outperforms existing methods on Needle-in-a-Haystack and InfiniteBench, all while achieving a remarkable 10.61$\times$ reduction in decoding latency at 128k context length. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/an-yongqi/rest-kv to facilitate reproducibility and further research.
